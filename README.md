# Spark Streaming Example Project

[ ![Build Status] [travis-image] ] [travis]  [ ![Release] [release-image] ] [releases] [ ![License] [license-image] ] [license]

## Introduction


This is a simple time-series analysis stream processing job ([introductory blog post] blog-post) written in Scala for the [Spark Streaming] spark-streaming cluster computing platform, processing JSON events from [Amazon Kinesis] kinesis and writing aggregates to [Amazon DynamoDB] dynamodb.
This was built by the Data Science team at [Snowplow Analytics] snowplow, who use Spark Streaming in their client projects.


**Running this requires an Amazon AWS account, and it will incur charges.**

## Overview

We have implemented a super-simple analytics-on-write stream processing job using Spark Streaming. Our Spark Streaming job reads a Kinesis stream containing events in a JSON format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2015-06-05T12:54:43.064528",
  "type": "Green",
  "id": "4ec80fb1-0963-4e35-8f54-ce760499d974"
}
```

OOur job counts the events by type and aggregates these counts into 1-minute buckets. The job then takes these aggregates and saves them into a table in DynamoDB:

![dynamodb-table-image][dynamodb-table-image]

## Developer Quickstart

Assuming git, [Vagrant] [vagrant-install] and [VirtualBox] [virtualbox-install] installed:

```bash
 host$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/spark-streaming-example-project.git
 host$ cd spark-streaming-example-project
 host$ vagrant up && vagrant ssh
guest$ cd /vagrant
guest$ sbt compile
```

## Tutorial

You can follow along in [the release blog post] [blog-post] to get the project up and running yourself.

The below steps assume that you are running inside Vagrant, as per the Developer Quickstart above.

### 1. Setting up AWS

First we need to configure a default AWS profile:

```bash
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: ...
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ...
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

Now we create our Kinesis event stream:

```bash
$ inv create_kinesis_stream default my-stream
```

Wait a minute and then:

```bash
$ inv describe_kinesis_stream default my-stream
{
    "StreamDescription": {
        "StreamStatus": "ACTIVE",
        "StreamName": "my-stream",
        "StreamARN": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:719197435995:stream/my-stream",
        "Shards": [
            {
                "ShardId": "shardId-000000000000",
                "HashKeyRange": {
                    "EndingHashKey": "340282366920938463463374607431768211455",
                    "StartingHashKey": "0"
                },
                "SequenceNumberRange": {
                    "StartingSequenceNumber": "49551350243544458458477304430170758137221526998466166786"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

If the Kinesis response says that the stream is still being created, wait a minute and then try again.

Now create our DynamoDB table:

```bash
$ inv create_dynamodb_table default us-east-1 my-table
```

### 2. Sending events to Kinesis

We need to start sending events to our new Kinesis stream. We have created a helper method to do this - run the below and leave it running: 

```bash
$ inv generate_events default us-east-1 my-stream
Event sent to Kinesis: {"timestamp": "2015-06-05T12:54:43.064528", "type": "Green", "id": "4ec80fb1-0963-4e35-8f54-ce760499d974"}
Event sent to Kinesis: {"timestamp": "2015-06-05T12:54:43.757797", "type": "Red", "id": "eb84b0d1-f793-4213-8a65-2fb09eab8c5c"}
Event sent to Kinesis: {"timestamp": "2015-06-05T12:54:44.295972", "type": "Yellow", "id": "4654bdc8-86d4-44a3-9920-fee7939e2582"}
...
```

Now open up a separate terminal for the rest of the setup.

### 3. Running our job on Spark Streaming

First we need to build Spark Streaming with Kinesis support. This can take up to 90 minutes:

```bash
$ inv build_spark
...
[INFO] Spark Kinesis Integration ......................... SUCCESS [1:11.115s]
...
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 1:29:00.686s
[INFO] Finished at: Sun Jun 07 00:32:09 UTC 2015
[INFO] Final Memory: 94M/665M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Now we build our application. This should take closer to 10 minutes:

```bash
$ inv build_project
...
```

Finally we can submit our job to Spark with this command:

```bash
$ inv run_project config/config.hocon.sample
...
```

If you have updated any of the configuration options above (e.g. stream name or region), then you will have to update the `config.hocon.sample` file accordingly.

### 4. Monitoring your job

First review the spooling output of the `run_project` command above - it's very verbose, but if you don't see any Java stack traces in there, then Spark Streaming should be running okay.

Now head over to your host machine's [localhost:4040] [localhost-4040] and you should see something like this:

![spark-ui-image][spark-ui-image]

You can see how our Spark Streaming job _discretizes_ the Kinesis event stream into 2-second-duration "micro-batches", which are each then processed as a discrete Spark job.

Finally, let's check the data in our DynamoDB table. Make sure you are in the correct AWS region, then click on `my-table` and hit the `Explore Table` button:

![dynamodb-table-image][dynamodb-table-image]

For each **BucketStart** and **EventType** pair, we see a **Count**, plus some **CreatedAt** and **UpdatedAt** metadata for debugging purposes. Our bucket size is 1 minute, and we have 5 discrete event types, hence the matrix of rows that we see.

## Roadmap

* Porting this job to [AWS Lambda] [aws-lambda-example-project]
* Various improvements for the [0.2.0 release] [020-milestone]
* Expanding our analytics-on-write thinking into our new [Icebucket] [icebucket] project
